Dear Webdesk Administrator!
</p>
<p>This is an automatic mail from the webdesk ewp system. Do not reply! It was generated because a webdesk user
or a webdesk job tried to create objects (f.i. employees or users), which would violate your currently purchased licence.</p>

<br/>
Your current licence status:<br/>

<br/>
Licence holder: ${company}, ${companyDesc} 
<br/>

<table border="1">
<tr>
    <th>Licence</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Currently in Use</th>
    <th>Licenced Max</th>
</tr>
#foreach( $licInfo in $licenceInfos )
	<tr>
	   <td>$licInfo.name</td>
	   <td>$languageService.translate( $licInfo.description )</td>
	   #set( $maxInUse = $licInfo.maxInUse - 1)
	   <td>$maxInUse</td>
	   <td>$licInfo.amount</td>
	</tr>
#end
</table>

<p>Please contact your local sales representative or directly Workflow EDV GmbH at +43 1 7188842 0</p>
